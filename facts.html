        <li>The word “Islam” means “submission to the will of God.”</li>
        <li>Followers of Islam are called Muslims.</li>
        <li>Muslims are monotheistic and worship one, all-knowing God, who in Arabic is known as Allah.</li>
        <li>Muslims aim to live a life of complete submission to Allah. They believe that nothing can happen without Allah’s permission, but humans have free will.</li>
        <li>Islam teaches that Allah’s word was revealed to the prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel.</li>
        <li>Muslims believe several prophets were sent to teach Allah’s law. </li>
        <li>Mosques are places where Muslims worship.</li>
