        <li>Sunnah, as a term, has a few definitions based on different groups of Muslim scholars depending on their respective disciplines. Below are three definitions of the Sunnah according to the following groups:

Scholars of Hadith (Muḥaddithūn)
According to them, Sunnah is what has been passed down from Prophet Muhammad’s statements, actions, tacit approvals, manners, or physical characteristics, regardless of whether it was before or after he was appointed as a prophet. Their definition includes that of the Saḥābah (companions of the Prophet s.a.w.) or the Tabi‘ūn (the next generation who followed the Saḥābah)..”</li>
        <li>Scholars of Fiqh or Islamic Jurisprudence (Fuqahā’)
The fuqahā’ or jurists define Sunnah as a recommended act. A person will be rewarded if he or she performs it and will not be punished if he or she does not perform it. There are other terms used for this specific meaning, such as mustahabb, mandūb, taṭawwu‘ and nāfilah, each of which may have a slightly different connotation in some cases. These scholars study the Prophet’s traditions to identify the religious rulings of the actions; what is wājib (compulsory), mustahabb (commendable), ḥarām (prohibited) and makrūh (discouraged).</li>
        <li>Scholars of Uṣūl al-Fiqh or Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence (Uṣūliyyun)
These scholars define Sunnah as what is narrated from the Prophet s.a.w. in terms of his sayings, actions and approvals that can be used as evidence for a rule in Islamic law. The uṣūliyyun study the Prophet’s traditions to extract legal maxims for the Mujtahidūn (scholars who are qualified to exercise ijtihād or independent reasoning in the interpretation of Islamic Law) to conceptually guide the masses in living their ever-changing life.

There are definitely some similarities and distinctions in the definitions. To put it simply, Sunnah is attributed to the Prophet s.a.w, regardless of whether it is the religious ruling or a commendable act, depending on the context of usage. In any given text, understanding the definitions of Sunnah from the different disciplines could help us avoid semantic confusion, especially in determining aḥkām (rulings). </li>
        <li>Sunnah is the second source of our tradition after the Quran
The reason why Sunnah is regarded as highly as the divine revelation that provides guidance to the community is because Allah s.w.t. Himself says in the Quran regarding the sayings of the Prophet s.a.w:

وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰٓ. إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْىٌ يُوحَىٰ

“Nor does he speak of his own whims. It is only a revelation sent down (to him).”

(Surah An-Najm, 53:3-4)</li>
